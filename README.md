## Pands Problem Sheet Solutions

<p>A weekly task was given as part of the Programming and Scripting module. Solutions using the Python<br> programming language are included, comments on the code and references pointing to where some of ideas for the code was obtained.</p>

1. A program that calculates a persons body mass index.
- The user is asked to input height and weight, these values are entered in a formula to output the BMI.

2. A program that asks a user to input a string, & outputs every second letter in reverse order.
- The code starts at the end of the string, and pops off every second letter from there.

3. A program that asks a user to input a positive integer and outputs the succesive vales of the following<br>
   calculation: At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even<br>
   divide by two, if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end when the current<br>
   value is one.
- A function that contained an if else statement was created to output what is known as a Collatz series.
- Varioustring methods were used to tidy up the output.

4. Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
- This involved importing a 'built-in' module called 'datetime'. There are many built-in modules in Python 
- that allow one to carry out many tasks that otherwise would not be possible. 

5. Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input, and outputs an approximation of its 
   square root.
- Here I defined a function and used a while loop to performs calculations and output the result using 
- 'return'. String formatting was used to make the output look clearer.

6. A program that counts the number of 'e's in a file.
- This was a new area of Python that explored reading and writing to a file and using the built-in os module
- to allow the user to output what is in a file from a command line.

7. A program that displays a line graph of three different functions.
- This involved exploring an area of Python used to get graphical outputs and using different Python syntax
- and methods on the built-in mathplotlib.pyplot module to adjust the line graph.
